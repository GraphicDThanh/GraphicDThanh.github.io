I used to be a member of the [STEAM for Vietnam](https://steamforvietnam.org/) team (this journey blog), with roles as:

- Teacher Assistant Leader (robotics team)
- Python Lecture CS201


STEAM for Vietnam is a non-profit organization with the hope of bringing free STEAM education models to Vietnamese students everywhere to expose them to programming at an early age.
