## Author
I’m Thanh, the author of BeautyOnCode👋. With over a decade of experience in the tech industry 👷🏼 🛠 🐞, I specialize in web technologies, including:

- **🌱 Foundations**: Linux, Git, Algorithms
- **🔤 Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, and more
- **📕 Libraries & Frameworks**: React, Redux, Next.js, Node.js, NestJS, Django, DRF, pandas, .NET, and others
- **📦 Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **☁️ Cloud Platforms**: AWS

Since 2014, I’ve been working as a developer at 🏚 [AgilityIO](https://www.agilityio.com/) in Da Nang, Vietnam 🏖, where I also mentor junior developers and lead medium-sized teams.

## Activity
Outside of work, I volunteered with STEAM for Vietnam 🙋🏻‍♀️, guiding young students in programming as a TA leader and Python lecturer. I’m also a curator on Careerly ✍🏻, supporting the Vietnamese tech community. By late 2022, BeautyOnCode had reached top author status on Careerly, with a following of over 5,000 readers 🎯.

Currently, I dedicate time to deepening my technical knowledge 👩🏻‍💻 and am less active on social media than before 🙆🏻‍♀️.

This blog captures my journey as a developer—continuously learning, evolving, and sharing the tools, web techniques, and insights that shape my growth.
