Welcome to BeautyOnCode – Code Your Life in an Elegant Way

BeautyOnCode is a tech blog dedicated to unraveling the intricacies of software development, one line of code at a time. Since its inception in 2019, this space has been a platform for sharing insights, practical tips, and personal reflections on the ever-evolving world of programming.

Whether you're delving into backend fundamentals, exploring cloud architectures, mastering frontend design, or refining UI/UX strategies, BeautyOnCode offers something for every tech enthusiast seeking to deepen their knowledge and stay inspired.

## Author
I’m Thanh Nguyen Diem, the author of BeautyOnCode. With over a decade of experience in the tech industry, I specialize in web technologies, including:

- **Foundations**: Linux, Git, Algorithms
- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, and more
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: React, Redux, Next.js, Node.js, NestJS, Django, DRF, pandas, .NET, and others
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS

Since 2014, I’ve been working as a developer at [AgilityIO](https://www.agilityio.com/) in Da Nang, Vietnam, where I also mentor junior developers and lead medium-sized teams.

## Activity
Outside of work, I volunteered with STEAM for Vietnam, guiding young students in programming as a TA leader and Python lecturer. I’m also a curator on Careerly, supporting the Vietnamese tech community. By late 2022, BeautyOnCode had reached top author status on Careerly, with a following of over 5,000 readers.

Currently, I dedicate time to deepening my technical knowledge and am less active on social media than before.

## Blog topics
In this blog, I document my ongoing journey as a developer, continuously learning and sharing the tools, techniques, and thoughts that shape my growth.
