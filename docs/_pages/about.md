BeautyOnCode is a tech blog dedicated to exploring the intricacies of software development, one line of code at a time. Since 2019, BeautyOnCode has been a space where I share insights, practical tips, and personal reflections on the programming world. From backend fundamentals and cloud architectures to frontend design and UI/UX strategies, this blog has something for every tech enthusiast looking to deepen their understanding and stay inspired.

## Author
I’m Thanh Nguyen Diem, the author behind BeautyOnCode. With over a decade in the tech industry, my experience spans backend technologies like C#/.NET, Python, Django, and Node.js, and I’m equally passionate about creating intuitive user experiences with React, Redux, and Next.js. 

Since 2014, I’ve been working as a developer at [AgilityIO](https://www.agilityio.com/) in Da Nang, Vietnam, where I also mentor junior developers and lead medium-sized teams.

## Activity
Outside of work, I volunteer with STEAM for Vietnam, guiding young students in programming as a TA leader and Python lecturer. I’m also a curator on Careerly, supporting the Vietnamese tech community. By late 2022, BeautyOnCode had reached top author status on Careerly, with a following of over 5,000 readers.
