## BeautyOnCode Blog

Hi my friend,

I'm Thanh, a web developer. 
My official blog at [BeautyOnCode][official-blog], written in Vietnamese.

I am learning to write tech blog in English at this new domain, [chickytech.link][origin-link].

I built this [github page][github-page] with jekyll, then link the domain `<username>.github.io` to the domain on Route 53 of AWS.

If you want to start a blog without cost on hosting and write content in markdown then you could try this way.

Connect with me on [Linkedin][linkedin]
